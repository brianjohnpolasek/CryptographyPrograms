### Running the Algorithms

Each algorithm is completely containted within the file bearing its name. There are two methods for running each program;


1. **System Prompts:**

From a terminal, navigate to the directory with the target file which you would like to run using the _"cd"_ command, then run the program using the command _"python NAME.py"_ where NAME is the name of the file you would like to run.

2. **Command Line Arguments:**

Again, navigagte to the correct directory, then execute the script using _"python NAME.py arg1 arg2..."_ where NAME is the name of the file and all of the appropriate variables are listed following the name and separated by spaces.
