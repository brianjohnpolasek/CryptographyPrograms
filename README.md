### Crytography Algorithms Done in Python

The goal of this repository will be to create both interactive and realistic models of common cryptographic algorithms.

A few preliminary works have already been added and include the following:

* Caeser Cipher
* Euclidean Algorithm
* RSA Cryptographic Scheme
* El Gamal Cryptographic Scheme
* The Miller-Rabin test for primality
